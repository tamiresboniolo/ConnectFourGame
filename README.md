# Connect Four Game


This project I implement a computer version of Connect 4 that allows a human to play a computer. For each turn, I prompt the human player for the number of the column that they wish to drop a checker into. Then, I have the computer player select the column for their turn randomly. The program shows the playing grid after each turn. If one of the players gets 4 checkers in a row, the program detect that, end the game and announce the winner. In addition,it is not checking for diagonal win, I just check for 4 checkers in a row either horizontally or vertically.
